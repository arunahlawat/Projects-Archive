# SQL
| Project Name | Description |  
|---|---|
| üçú[Danny's Diner](https://github.com/arunahlawat/SQL-Danny-s-Diner-Project) | Use data to answer a few simple question about customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with customers will help the owner to deliver a better and more personalised experience for their loyal customers.
